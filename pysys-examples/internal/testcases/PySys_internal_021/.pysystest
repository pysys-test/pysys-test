    <title>Process Module - start process in background</title>    
    <purpose><![CDATA[
Tests for the successfull execution of a process in the background. The startProcess 
method should not block in this case, allowing concurrent execution within the testcase. 
The running() method on the process handle is used to query the running status of the 
process, and the waitProcess method is used to wait for completion of the process until 
the process has completed execution.
