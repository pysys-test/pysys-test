    <title>Writers and logging - logging and logFileContents of I18N characters with various locale combinations</title>    
    <purpose><![CDATA[
Checks that I18N characters in log statements, 
logFileContents and outcome reason are either represented correctly or replaced 
by ? or similar when running in a locale that does not support them (7 bit ASCII). 
Main goal is checking that they do not result in messages or outcome reasons going missing, 
which makes tests very hard to debug - logging really needs to be rock solid. 

Uses multiple threads, which tests extra logic we have for buffering before writing to stdout. 
Also includes testing with and without coloring as especially on windows this results in 
changes to sys.stdout as well as some interesting control characters.
