"""
Welcome to the PySys System Test Framework.

`pysys.basetest` contains (or provides links to) pretty much everything you need for the main business of creating 
testcases using PySys.

However for more advanced users, it is possible to customize many aspects of PySys behaviour by providing custom 
implementations of PySys classes described in this API reference:

	- `pysys.baserunner.BaseRunner` to customize orchestration of all the tests in a test run. 
	- `pysys.writer` classes to customize how test outcomes are recorded.
	- `pysys.perf` to customize how numeric performance results are reported.
	- `pysys.config.descriptor.DescriptorLoader` to customize how PySys find and runs tests (e.g. to support running tests 
	  from other frameworks within PySys). 
	- `pysys.utils.logutils.BaseLogFormatter` for advanced customization of log message format.

There are also many utility functions which could be helpful when creating custom assertion methods. However before 
using any functions from `pysys.utils`, always check first if there is a more convenient method available to do the 
job on `pysys.basetest.BaseTest`/`pysys.baserunner.BaseRunner`.
