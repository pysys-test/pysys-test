	Get a reference to project root location (the location of this file), which can then be used 
	as a substitution variable within the project file. Note that this is only for local expansion 
	within the project file, where the project root location is required for full paths, e.g. 
	stylesheets etc. Within a test class, the root location can be referenced using the 
	PROJECT.root class variable. If not specified, defaults to "root".
	-->
	<property root="rootdir"/>
	
	
	<!-- 
	Set a property on the project class. The property can then be used as a substitution variable 
	within the project file, and is also set as an attribute to the project class so it's value 
	can be reference internally within the PySys framework, e.g. in the below example, user would 
	be set on the project class referenced by pysys.constants.PROJECT, such that PROJECT.user is 
	the USERNAME taken from the environment, or guest if the variable is not defined within the 
	environment. The literal value can be set directly on the property, in which case the default 
	attribute is not required, e.g. <property name="maxFails" value="100"/>	
	 -->

	<!-- 
	Import properties from file (fails silently if the file does not exist). The imported 
	file should be of the format name=value (one pair specified per line). Any imported names
	can again be used as a substitution variables within the project file, and are also set as 
	attributes to the project class. The value in the imported file can be defined to use 
	substitution through the ${variable} syntax (where variable must be defined before the import
	 -->
	<property file="${osfamily}.properties" />
	

	<!-- 
	Add a path to the python path to allow importing custom modules, e.g. extensions to the 
	BaseTest or BaseRunner classes, or customer test output writers. If the relative attribute 
	is set to true, then the path is treated as relative to the project root location; otherwise 
	the path is treated as absolute, e.g. to add the src directory to the python path at runtime 
	use;
	
	<path value="./src" relative="true" />
	-->


	<!-- 
	Use a custom runner class that extends the BaseRunner class distributed with PySys. Extensions to 
	the BaseRunner are used to define custom setup and tear down operations before running the set of 
	selected tests (e.g. to load test data into a relational database prior to the test runs, and then 
	clear out the data on completion), as well as to defined operations between the execution of individual 
	tests and after completion of a cycle of tests. For example, to use the MyRunner class in the 
	com.company.test module use;
	
	<runner classname="MyRunner" module="com.company.test"/>
	-->


	<!-- 
	Use a custom maker class for constructing new testcases. Custom maker classes can extend from the 
	ConsoleMakeTestHelper class in order to create templated run.py scripts e.g. when a test module has
	a repeatable pattern for running or validating etc. 
	
	<maker classname="MyMaker" module="com.company.test"/>
	-->


	<!--
	Set the test writers to write the test summary at runtime when the -r option is 
	passed to the run mode of the pysys launcher. Multiple test writers can be configured
	and properties can be set on the writers using a nested property tag; these are then set 
	as attributes of the class. PySys ships the XMLResultsWriter, TextResultsWriter and 
	JUnitXMLResultsWriter class as three example writers, though custom writers can be created 
	e.g. to insert into a relational database etc (see pysys.writers.__init__.py for the source 
	code for the distributed writers). If no writer is specified in the project file, the 
	XMLResultsWriter is used. 
	
	The writer tag details the classname (which should be added to the pythonpath using the 
	path tag) and the module of the writer class. Where single file output is produced by the 
	writer, the optional filename attribute is used to denote the filename template for the output 
	logging. The filename template is processed through time.strftime so that time information can 
	be set into the filename, e.g. a filename template of 'testsummary-%Y%m%d%H%M%S.xml' will result 
	in a file created with a name of  testsummary-20081025213308.xml etc.
