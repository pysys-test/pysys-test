PySys 1.3.1 Release Notes
=========================

PySys can be used with Python 2.7 or Python 3.5 and later. 

See installation notes in README.rst for more details.

What's new in this release
--------------------------
- Fixed startProcess to add a BLOCKED test outcome when a process fails to 
  start due to a PocessError, unless ignoreExitStatus=True. Previously this 
  flag only affected non-zero exit codes resulting in ProcessError failures 
  getting ignored. 
  

Release History
---------------
1.2.0 to 1.3.0
--------------------------
Changes affecting compatibility:
- Fixed assertDiff (and filediff) handling of "include" expressions list to 
  filter out lines if no include expressions match (as documented) rather 
  than if any include expressions match. This fix may cause tests to fail 
  that had previously - and incorrectly - passed as a result of all lines 
  being filtered out before the comparison. There is also now a message 
  logged at warn level when every line in a file comparison is filtered 
  out, since in most cases this is not desirable behaviour. 
- Changed "pysys.py run" to return a non-zero exit code if any tests 
  failed, whereas previously it would return 0.
 
Other fixes and new features:
- PySys now provides 'single-source' support for both Python 2.7 and 
  Python 3.x, without the need for the 2to3.py script to be run at 
  installation time for use with Python 3.
- Added support for specifying what file encoding is to be used for reading 
  and writing text files (for example in waitForSignal and various 
  assertions). This is especially important for Python 3 where text files 
  are processed using unicode character strings rather than Python 2 
  byte "str" objects. The encoding can be specified explicitly on 
  individual methods the open files, or globally based on file names 
  or extensions by overriding the new ProcessUser.getDefaultFileEncoding() 
  method. For example, getDefaultFileEncoding could be overridden to 
  specify that .xml files should be treated as UTF-8 by default. If 
  the encoding is not specified explicitly or through 
  getDefaultFileEncoding(), Python selects the preferred encoding based 
  on the locale that it is running in. 
- Changed the way multiple cycles are executed in multi-threaded mode to 
  allow tests from different cycles to execute in parallel instead of waiting 
  for each cycle to fully complete before starting the next cycle. This 
  improved parallelism makes it much easier to reproduce race 
  conditions demonstrated by a single testcase, which was not possible 
  with the previous threading behaviour. To maintain existing 
  behaviour for users who have provided a runner.cycleComplete() method, 
  concurrent cycle execution will be disabled if cycleComplete() is overridden. 
  Anybody affected by this is encouraged to transition away from use of 
  cycleComplete() and perform any required cleanup tasks in 
  BaseTest.cleanup() or BaseRunner.testComplete() instead. 
- Added requires-python and requires-pysys elements to the project XML 
  file which allow checking for the specified minimum python or pysys 
  version, resulting in a clear error if attempting to use the wrong 
  version. 
- Added support for coloring console output to highlight passes, fails, 
  warnings and more. This is configured in the project configuration file. 
  Coloring can also be enabled or disabled for a particular user and/or 
  machine using the PYSYS_COLOR=true/false environment variable override. 
  Coloring works on any terminal that supports ANSI escape sequences (e.g. 
  most Unix terminals). On Windows, which does not, it is possible to get 
  colored output by installing a package such as "colorama", which PySys will 
  load if it is present on the python path. It is possible to customize the 
  colors used or to use alternative libraries for coloring on windows by 
  providing a custom ColorLogFormatter class. The colors used for each 
  category of log messages can be customized in the project configuration 
  file, e.g. 
  <formatter><property name="color:timed out" value="MAGENTA"/></formatter>
- Added ProcessUser.getExprFromFile helper method to automate the common task 
  of retrieving some text from a file, for example to capture information 
  such as a process identifier from a log file, or to extract some 
  performance results that were logged. 
- Added BaseTest.reportPerformanceResult() and a flexible framework for 
  recording performance results (e.g. throughput, latency etc) measured 
  by PySys tests, including storage of results in a human-readable and 
  machine-parseable CSV file together with run-specific information 
  such as the host where the test was executed. The CSV files can be 
  aggregated across multiple test runs and/or cycles and imported into 
  any spreadsheet for comparisons and more detailed analysis. The standard 
  CSVPerformanceReporter can be subclassed and replaced with an alternative 
  recording mechanism if desired (e.g. writing directly to a database or 
  other file format). Fibonacci_test_005 demonstrates how performance 
  results can be reported using this framework. 
- Added support for providing a custom class to implement formatting of 
  log messages, for both run.log and stdout. Errors in the <formatters> XML 
  node will now be treated as errors rather than being silently ignored. 
- Changed pysys.py to ignore trailing slash characters on test ids, which 
  makes it easier to use shell tab completion to select a specific test. 
- Fixed pysys.py command line parser to give a clear error if requested to 
  execute a non-existent test id, or if the test descriptor XML could 
  not be parsed. Previously invalid test ids would be either silently 
  ignored without an error, or would result in other test ids being 
  executed more than once. 
- Fixed startProcess to use the test output directory (rather than the current 
  working directory) as the root when a relative path is specified 
  for the workingDir argument. 
- Fixed bug in which log level and exception tracebacks were being 
  inadvertently suppressed from the stdout console output when executing 
  from multiple threads. 
- Fixed manual tester thread to report a BLOCKED outcome instead of hanging 
  if a fatal error occurs (e.g. Tck does not load due to DISPLAY not being 
  configured correctly). 
- Added BaseResultsWriter class and associated docstring documentation to 
  make it easier to create new results writers. 
- Changed standard record writers to report the number of cycles starting 
  from 1 rather than from 0 (which is consistent with how cycles are 
  displayed by the rest of PySys).
- Extended the concept of "writers" to include not just "record" writers 
  (which are enabled only when --record is specified) but also "summary" 
  writers which are always enabled and log a summary at the end of test 
  execution (if none is explicitly configured a default 
  ConsoleSummaryResultsWriter is instantiated), and "progress" writers 
  which are enabled only when --progress is specified and log progress 
  information throughout a run. 
- The monolithic logic for writing a summary to the console at the end of 
  test execution has been refactored out of baserunner and into 
  the configurable and separately extendable ConsoleSummaryResultsWriter class. 
  Any baserunner subclasses that are currently overriding the summary printing 
  functionality and/or making use of the results dictionary returned by start() 
  should now switch to using "summary" writers instead. This functionality 
  will be removed in a future release and is now deprecated.
- The default summary results writer now has a configuration parameter 
  showOutcomeReason which causes the outcome reason string to be included 
  underneath each failure outcome, to provide a quick summary of what went 
  wrong. 
- The default summary results writer now has a configuration parameter 
  showOutputDir which causes the path to the test's output directory 
  to be printed underneath each failure outcome, to make it easy to quickly 
  find and open the relevant files to debug the failure. 
- Added a --progress command line option (can also be switched on using 
  the PYSYS_PROGRESS=true environment variable), which logs a summary of 
  how many test have executed, outcomes, a list of most recent failure 
  reasons and a list of what other tests are currently executing. This 
  provides very helpful feedback to the user while executing a long 
  test run. The progress reporting is implemented in a fully extensible 
  way using a new kind of 'progress' result writer. A custom progress 
  result writer class can be configured for a project; if none is 
  specified the default ConsoleProgressResultsWriter is added automatically. 
- Fixed unexpected DEBUG logging on standard output after any of the 
  Python logging.info/warn/error() methods is called. This behaviour was 
  triggered if certain libraries (e.g SSL libraries) were not available 
  when python starts. 
- Added defaultIgnoreExitStatus project property which controls whether 
  non-zero return codes from startProcess() result in test failures, when the 
  ignoreExitStatus flag is not explicitly specified. To retain the same 
  behaviour for existing projects, defaultIgnoreExitStatus is set to True if 
  the property is not configured in the project configuration. However to 
  promote best practice for new PySys projects, the example pysys project 
  configuration file sets defaultIgnoreExitStatus to False, which ensures 
  that processes taht return failure codes are not ignored unless explicitly 
  intended by the author of the testcase. 
- Fixed waitForSocket, which in previous versions immediately returned 
  success instead of waiting a valid socket connection as documented. 
- If the test run is interrupted from the keyboard, the prompt that asks 
  whether to continue to run tests is no longer displayed if there are no more 
  tests left to run. The prompt can also be completely disabled using an 
  environment variable PYSYS_DISABLE_KBRD_INTERRUPT_PROMPT=true, for users who 
  prefer Ctrl+C to immediately terminate the test run in all cases. 
- Added pysys.utils.pycompat module containing a small set of helpers for 
  writing code that works with Python 2 and Python 3. 
- Fixed writing to process stdin so that if a character string is passed in it 
  will be converted to a byte object automatically, using the default 
  encoding. Previously, it was not possible to write character strings in 
  Python 3, and in Python 2 it would only work if they contained only ascii 
  characters. 


1.1.1 to 1.2.0
--------------
- Added the errorExpr argument to the waitForSignal method. Occurrence of any
  matches to expressions in this argument will terminate the waitForSignal
  loop, allowing early exit prior to the timeout.
- Refactored reconfiguration of global logging out of the pysys __init__.py
  class into the pysys.py launcher. This allows other applications making
  use of the PySys framework to make their own logging decisions.
- Improved useability of the assertDiff method by writing out the unified
  diff to a file in the output subdirectory so failures are easier to triage.
- Added the literal argument to the assertGrep method to avoid having to
  escape regular expressions.
- Added the utils.fileutils module for miscellaneous file related utilities.


1.1.0 to 1.1.1
--------------
- The validateOnly option has been added to the pysys.py run launcher
  task. When set the purge output subdirectory, setup and execute methods
  on the test will not be invoked. This makes it easier to fix validation
  errors in the test without the need to re-run the entire test.
- The logFileContents() method has been added to the pysys.basetest.BaseTest
  class to allow logging of file contents to the run.log. This can be used
  to provide additional diagnostic information to the run.log to assist
  the triage of test failures.
- The CSVResultsWriter has been added to the set of test summary writers.
  See the pysysproject.xml file in pysys-examples for more details.
- It is now possible to specify a regex for matching in the test selection.
  See the run usage for more details (pysys.py run -h).


0.9.3 to 1.1.0
--------------
- This release introduces optional fail fast semantics at a macro and micro
  level. At a macro level this is either through the "defaultAbortOnError"
  project property, or through the "-b|--abort" option to the pysys launcher
  run task. See the pysysproject.xml file in pysys-examples, and the run task
  help usage respectively for more details. At a micro level, all assert and
  process related methods now take an optional "abortOnError" parameter to
  override any macro setting. When enabled any error will cause the test to
  immediately fail, reporting the failure reason.
- Outcomes which are considered a fail now log information as to the cause
  of the failure. Additionally a call record is reported, giving a comma
  separated list of "module:lineno" entries detailing the call stack up to
  the test class instance. This is to aid diagnosing test failure causes.
- The test title is now output to console when running the test.
- The BaseRunner class now contains an isPurgableFile() method. This method
  can be overridden by any extensions to denote if a zero length file should
  be purged from the output subdirectory after running of the test.
- It is now possible to register cleanup functions in the BaseTest to negate
  the need to override the cleanup() action where a call to
  BaseTest.cleanup(self) must specifically be made. See the epydoc for the
  addCleanupFunction() in the ProcessUser module.

0.9.2 to 0.9.3
--------------
- Added Darwin as a supported platform.
- Added the maker tag to the pysysproject file to allow specifiying a
  custom test maker class, e.g. to create specific run templates etc.
  See the pysysproject.xml file in pysys-examples for more information.
- The make option to pysys.py now accepts the testcase directory to be
  specified to a value other than the current working directory.

0.9.1 to 0.9.2
--------------
- The method getNextAvailableTCPPort has been added to the 
  pysys.basetest.BaseTest class to allow users to allocate server TCP ports 
  in a robust manner.
- The unix and windows process helpers have been updated to fix handle leaks 
  (defect #11 "ProcessMonitor leaks file handles"), and to delete the stdin 
  queue when processes go away. 

0.9.0 to 0.9.1
--------------
- Fixed issue with the determination of the overall test outcome due to the 
  incorrect use of the inbuilt sorted() function. The issue meant the test
  outcome list was not correctly sorted based on precedent, leading to the 
  incorrect determination of the overall test outcome. 
- Fixed issue in the pysys.basetest on handling FileNotFoundExceptions in 
  the assert* methods. The exception was not being caught, leading to 
  subsequent asserts in the test class not being performed. 

0.8.1 to 0.9.0
--------------
- The PySys framework has been updated to be compliant with conversion to 
  Python 3.x with the 2to3.py conversion script. Installation on Python 3.x 
  is now supported via the source distribution bundle, where the 2to3.py 
  script is run automatically at install time. See details below for 
  installing the source distribution. A binary distribution installer for 
  windows will be included in a later release. 
- There are now separate 32 and 64 bit binary distribution installers for 
  windows. 
- On failure of the assertLineCount method, the log output now contains the 
  returned number and requested condition (tracker #3045931)  
- Each assert method now takes an "assertMessage" parameter to be written
  to the log output on execution (tracker #3045924). See test
  PySys_internal_053 in the example testcases for example usage.
- Added the JUnitXMLResultsWriter to log test results in Apache Ant JUnit 
  XML format (one output file per test per cycle). This is useful for 
  integration into Continuous Integration build systems, e.g. TeamCity. The 
  TextResultsWriter and XMLResultsWriter now support the outputDir property 
  to specify the location to write the output files. See the pysys-examples 
  pysysproject.xml file for more details.
- Added the ability to run suites of pyunit tests wrapped up as a single 
  PySys test. This capability is exposed through the PyUnitTest class 
  contained in the pysys.unit.pyunit module. See the pysys-examples pyunit
  tests for example usage.
- Fix to the unix process helper to correctly set the working directory of 
  child processes in the fork and exec. 
- When running tests in parallel, a value of zero given for the 
  -n|--threads option to the run task of the pysys.py launcher, will set 
  the number of threads to the number of available CPUs.

0.7.6 to 0.8.1
--------------
- Updated the pysys.process.plat-win32.helper.ProcessWrapper module to 
  eliminate the use of threads to collect the stdout and stderr from the 
  process via pipes. The module now directly uses win32file.CreateFile to 
  create file objects to pass to the call to win32process.CreateProcess. 
- Added the <formatters/> element to the pysysproject file. This allows 
  setting the format of the test output to stdout and the runlog in 
  accordance to the format specifiers in the python logging and time 
  modules. For examples of the use of this element, see the pysysproject 
  file included in the PySys examples. 
- Logging of exceptions and failed asserts has been changed from info to 
  warn level (tracker #2784251).
- Added extra debug logging in pysys.utils.filegrep, and pysys.basetest 
  for when performing asserts against a line count in an input file 
  (tracker #2824758).
- The testcase output summary is now printed on termination of the test 
  run via a keyboard interrupt (tracker #2816212).
- The PySys project file now allows assignment of the project root 
  location to a variable which can then be used for later expansion within 
  the file. This allows the definition of project variables to include the 
  full path where this is required, e.g. XSL stylesheets which must use 
  the full path to the file rather than a relative path etc. Note that 
  modules within PySys can reference the project root location directly 
  using PROJECT.root (tracker #2795316). 
- The pysys.baserunner class now passes the -X arguments into the test 
  summary writer setup action to allow logging of the user supplied extra 
  arguments(tracker #2814499). The pysys-log.xsl stylesheet used by the 
  XMLResultsWriter 
  has been updated to display this information in the test summary display. 
- Fixed an issue where when the pysysproject file was missing, defaults 
  for the runner module and the test output summary writer were not being 
  set.

0.7.5 to 0.7.6
--------------
- Fixed a defect in the unix process helper module to correct a file 
  handle leak in the write end of the stdin pipe.

0.6.1 to 0.7.5
--------------
- Added the ability to run tests concurrently through the -n | --threads 
  option to the pysys launcher run target. Tests to be run are placed on a 
  request queue and processed by the designated number of worker threads. 
  The results of each test are then placed on a result queue, collated and 
  displayed in the order in which they would run serially. Depending on 
  the nature of the application under test, the recommended number of 
  threads to designate when using this option is no more than two times 
  the number of CPUs. Note also that care needs to be made when running 
  tests in parallel, so as to ensure no shared resources are accessed 
  in a non-atomic way, e.g using direct references to os.environ() in one 
  test when another test modifies the environment directly etc.
- The constructor to the pysys.baserunner.BaseRunner class was changed to 
  include the threads parameter, i.e.
  
  	def __init__(self, record, purge, cycle, mode, threads, outsubdir, descriptors, xargs)
  	
  This parameter is required for the runner to create the required 
  threadpool before running a set of tests in parallel. Any custom runner 
  classes extending the base runner will need to be updated to incorporate 
  this change. 
- Removed module specific loggers from pysys in order to support running 
  tests in parallel. There is now a single logger used within the 
  framework, and which can be referenced directly from the pysys.constants 
  module. Attached to this logger are two handler types; one for logging 
  to stdout, and one for logging to the run 
  log file saved in the output subdirectory of each test. The sdtout 
  handler is set to only log to stdout from the main thread, whilst the 
  run log file handlers are set to log to the output subdirectory of a 
  test only on the creating thread.
- Added exception handling to the pysys.process.user module when trying to 
  stop all processes on destruction. When a background process takes 
  longer to stop than the default timeout period, the thrown 
  pysys.exceptions.ProcessTimeout exception was uncaught causing abnormal 
  exit from the test run.  

0.6.0 to 0.6.1
--------------
- The clean target has been updated to accept the -a | --all command line 
  option to allow deleting all derived files produced when running a set 
  of testcases, i.e. both the testcase output subdirectory and any 
  compiled testclass modules.
- The waitForSignal method of the ProcessUser class, subclassed by both 
  the BaseTestand BaseRunner classes, has been updated to return a list of 
  match objects on invocation. By using tagged regular expressions in the 
  expr parameter of the method call, this allows retrieval of portions of 
  the matched data e.g. to extract expressions in the file to use later in 
  the validation routines. 
- All references to pysys.constants.TRUE and pysys.constants.FALSE have 
  been replaced by the native Python True and False literals. The values 
  of the constants have been set to True and False respectively so as to 
  maintain backwards compatibility.

0.5.2 to 0.6.0
--------------
- The PySys test and PySys project files have been renamed by default from  
  .pysystest to pysystest.xm, and .pysysproject to pysysproject.xml 
  respectively. Backwards compatability is maintained for the previous 
  file naming convention, though this will be deprecated in a later 
  release; it is strongly advised that the new naming convention is 
  adopted. New tests made using the PySys launcher will by default use the 
  new naming convention. This change was made due to issues on Windows 
  systems displaying and recognising hidden files, and files without 
  specified extensions e.g. within the Eclipse framework, for display in 
  internet browsers etc.
- The clean mode of operation has been added to the pysys.py launcher. This 
  allows removal of testcase output subdirectories, e.g. before importing 
  into a source code control system. The -o option allows specifying the 
  output subdirectory name to be deleted, which defaults to the platform 
  identifier if not specified. 
- The test output summary writer interface has been changed so that the 
  test output is written and updated during the test execution; previously 
  a call to the writer was only made on completion of the test run. This 
  allows monitoring the test output summary during the test execution to 
  monitor the run time status of the tests. 
- Added the XMLFileResultsWriter class to the pysys.writer module. This 
  performs logging of the test output summary in an XML format, suitable
  for display via XLST in a web browser. A simple XSL stylesheet is 
  included with the PySys distribution to provide better display in 
  internet browsers. 
- Added the ability to specifiy custom test output summary writers in the 
  PySys project file via the <writer> tag. For an example see the 
  .pysysproject file in the pysys-examples distribution. Should no 
  <writer> be specified in the project file, the default 
  XMLFileResultsWriter will be used. Multiple writers may be specified in 
  the PySys project file.  
- Added exception logging on parsing errors in the PySys project file, e.g. 
  when the file in badly formed due to invalid XML tokens etc.
- Added variable argument passing to the process.monitor.ProcessMonitor 
  class constructor so that operating specific arguments can be passed 
  into the class on instantiation. The wrapper method 
  pysys.basetest.BaseTest.startProcessMonitor has also been updated to 
  allow pass through of the variable arguments. 
- The win32 process.monitor module has been changed so that on windows 
  systems the percentage CPU usage is not normalised by default by the 
  number of available processors, e.g. on a 4 core processor if 2 cores 
  were fully utilized the CPU usage was previously output as 50% - the 
  change means that the reported usage will now be 200% (a value of 100% 
  indicates that one core is fully utilitised). This makes the output 
  consistent with that reported on unix systems. Should the 
  previous behavior be required the numProcessors argument can be passed 
  to the pysys.basetest.BaseTest.startProcessMonitor method in order to 
  normalise the CPU usage statistics by the number of processors. On 
  windows systems the number of processors can be obtained from the 
  NUM_PROCESSORS environment variable.
- Added comments to the PySys Project file distributed with the example 
  testcases, to detail the possible configuration options.

0.5.1 to 0.5.2
--------------
- The lastgrep method has been added to pysys.utils.filegrep, and the 
  assertLastGrep method has been added to the BaseTest class. This allows 
  test validation to be performed based on regular expression matching on 
  the last line of an input file to the assertLastGrep method.
- The win32 process monitor has been modified to calculate the percentage 
  CPU usage statistics as a sum over all available processors. A CPU usage 
  of 100% represents the process fully utilising all available processors. 
- The win32 process monitor now also logs the handle count of a process.

0.5.0 to 0.5.1
--------------
- Fixed a bug in pysys.process.user.ProcessUser destructor to explicitly 
  set the process list to null to allow process handles to be cleaned up 
  on destruction. This bug only seemed to be exhibited when the process 
  handle of a process returned in the startProcess() method was set as a 
  data attribute to an instance of the class. This handle was then both a 
  data attribute of the class, and was contained in a list data attribute 
  of the class. Under these conditions the handles were not being released 
  correctly.
- The print mode of the pysys.py launcher now supports printing out the 
  test user defined modes, and the printing out of tests that can be run 
  in a given mode.
  
0.4.0 to 0.5.0
--------------
- The OSFAMILY constant has been added to pysys.constants, and takes the 
  value 'windows' on all win32 operating systems, and 'unix' on sunos and 
  linux operating systems. The value of the OSFAMILY can be used within 
  the .pysysproject file using the osfamily attribute to the <property> 
  element. This allows capturing the value to be used in expansion of 
  other properties defined within the project file; see below for an 
  example usage. Should no value be set in a properties file, a default 
  value of "osfamily" is assumed. 
- The .pysysproject file now allows explicitly setting the environment 
  value to be used in expansions via the environment attribute to the 
  <property> element; see 
  below for an example usage. Should no value be set in a properties file, 
  a default value of "env" is assumed (this allows for backwards compatibility).
- The .pysysproject file now takes the file attribute to the <property> 
  element. This allows properties to be read from file, where the 
  properties are specified in the name=value syntax, e.g.
  
    <pysysproject>
      <property environment="env"/>
      <property osfamily="osfamily"/>
      <property file="${osfamily}.properties" />
      <property name="lib" value="${library}_${osfamily}_${version}_${env.USER}.so"/>
    </pysysproject>
  
  where the property file contains the following;
  
     version=1.0
     library=jstore${version}.jar
  
  For more details, see testcase PySys_internal_002 in the 
  pysys-examples/internal area which demonstrates this. 
  
- Fixed the issue of removing zero size files from the output subdirectory 
  on win32 platforms; was due to the stderr and stdout file handles not 
  being properly closed down. Updated the BaseRunner to attempt to remove 
  the zero sized files 3 times to try to avoid race conditions of stopped 
  background processes holding on to the file handles too long before dying.
- The win32 process helper now ensures the environment in which the  
  process runs is converted to unicode to avoid issues encountered with 
  running under certain locales. 

0.3.5 to 0.4.0
--------------
- The pysys.process.ProcessUser class has been added to define an 
  interface to subclasses which use the underlying process helper classes. 
  Both the BaseTest and BaseRunner classes now extend this so as to 
  provide a common interface for process manipulation. A common paradigm 
  for creating extension modules to PySys is to create a helper class 
  which provides the methods for starting an interacting with the 
  application under test (AUT). These helper classes have a call back to 
  an instance of the ProcessUser so that it can make use of the high level 
  process methods. As both the BaseTest and BaseRunner classes are 
  instances of the ProcessUser, the extension module helper classes can be 
  used in extensions to both of these to allow the AUT to be started both 
  within a testcase, and within the runner.
- The method signature to the pysys.utils.filereplace replace method has 
  been changed to set the default value for the marker to the empty string
- Bugs fixes for cleaning up leakage of threads from the process helpers, 
  and file handle leakage from the base runner classes.

0.3.4 to 0.3.5
--------------
- Fixed a bug a testcase was not being marked as BLOCKED when unable to 
  start a process using the process helper module.
- Failure on the assertOrderedGrep now prints out the line the failure 
  occurred on.

0.3.3 to 0.3.4
--------------
- Fixed a bug where timedout processes started in the foreground were not 
  being stopped automatically at the end of the testcase.
  
0.3.2 to 0.3.3
--------------
- The default name of the PySys test descriptor file has been changed from 
  "descriptor.xml", to ".pysystest". This change is to maintain a consistent
  naming convention across configuration files within the framework, e.g. 
  the project file ".pysysproject" denotes the project root and project 
  specific information, whilst a test file ".pysystest" denotes a testcase 
  within the project, and contains meta data for the test. Support for the 
  previous name is maintained, though it should be noted that testcases 
  created with the 'pysys.py make' command will have the new naming 
  convention used.
- The windows installer has been updated to add shortcuts to the 
  uninstaller, and to create a separate directory for the inclusion of 
  project extensions. 
- The getInstanceCount method has been added to the 
  pysys.basetest.BaseTest class to reference count the number of named 
  processes started during a test run. The startProcess method of the 
  class adds a reference count to an internal dictionary 
  structure keyed on the displayName passed into the method to achieve 
  this. 
- The writeProcess method has been added to the pysys.basetest.BaseTest 
  class to provide a wrapper around the write method of the underlying 
  process helper class. This wrapper perform a check on the running status 
  of the process prior to the write, and performs additional logging to 
  the run.log to audit the write. 
- Fixed a bug in the replace method of the filereplace module, where the 
  method signature was missing the marker parameter
- Added support to the pysys project file to allow adding path locations 
  to the Python path. See the .pysysproject file in pysys-examples for 
  more detail.

0.3.1 to 0.3.2
--------------
- Release was superceded immediately by the 0.3.3 release. See release 
  notes for new features for 0.3.3 for more information.

0.3.0 to 0.3.1
--------------
- The process helper modules have been updated to allow the writing to the 
  stdin of a process via the write() method on the process handle. 
- Several bug fixes have been applied to the unix process helper module.
- The pysys-examples/internal directory has been added to the examples 
  module. This will contain internal testcases for self testing the pysys 
  framework. These have been included in the distribution as examples of 
  the use of the framework.
- The pysys project file has been added into the framework to allow the 
  setting of project specific constants within the application. The 
  project file should be written to the base location of the project, with 
  the filename .pysysproject. The location of this file denotes the root 
  location of the project. For an example of the file see 
  pysys-examples/.pysysproject. Any name value properties
  within the file will be set as data attributes of the pysys.Project 
  class, which is referenced in the pysys.constants module using the 
  variable PROJECT. 

0.2.2 to 0.3.0
--------------
- Updates to the epydoc output for documenting the classes and modules of 
  pysys
- Addition of the pysys.py module for printing, running and making new 
  testcase directory structures. This allows a single distributed script 
  to be used to perform all functionality available from the console. 
- Remove of the run method from the console launch helper.

0.2.1 to 0.2.2
--------------
- The suites element in the test descriptor has been renamed to groups. 
  This is to allow testcases in a single directory to be classified as a 
  single testsuite, and subsets thereof to be regarded as a group
- Minor bug fixes to the manual tester and process module

0.2.0 to 0.2.1
--------------
- The Manual Tester has been updated to support the <expectedresult> 
  element in the input xml file. This allows display of the expected 
  result for a manual step to be presented in the user interface. The 
  ability to optionally record a defect in the log output is also now 
  included.
- The createDescriptors method has been removed from the 
  pysys.launcher.console package and moved into pysys.launcher. This 
  allows the utility method to be used for other custom launchers.

0.1.7 to 0.2.0
--------------
- This release includes updates to the Python doc strings for automated 
  generation of epydoc using the Epydoc package 
  (http://epydoc.sourceforge.net). The installer now distributes the 
  generated epydoc in the site-packages/pysys-doc directory. For 
  windows installs a link to the epydoc and release notes is now added as 
  a link in the start menu items
- Added the setup() method to the BaseTest class to allow custom setup 
  actions to be performed prior to execution of a particular test case
- Fixed a bug where if the --type option was not supplied to 
  ConsoleMakeTestHelper as a command line option, the resulting descriptor 
  had type="None"

0.1.6 to 0.1.7
--------------
- The Manual Tester UI has been updated so that it can be resized, and is 
  easier to navigate through the tests. 
- The BaseRunner start method now takes an optional list of result writer 
  class instances to perform test audit logging at the end of a test 
  cycle. This allows custom result writers to be passed to the runner to, 
  for example, write the results to a database, proprietary system etc
  
0.1.5 to 0.1.6
--------------
- Added the ability to differentiate between automated and manual 
  testcases using the test attribute to the pysystest element in the 
  testcase descriptor. If the attribute is not present the test will be 
  assumed to be an automated test. The runTest and printTest launch 
  helpers allow you to differentiate between automated and manual 
  tests using the --type command line argument. For more information see 
  the examples in pysys-examples

0.1.4 to 0.1.5
--------------
- Added support for the requirements traceability. This includes printing 
  requirements covered by a set of testcases, and running testcases which 
  cover a particular requirement id

0.1.3 to 0.1.4
--------------
- Added the ConsoleMakeTestHelper class to pysys.launcher.console. This 
  facilitates the creation of new testcase structures from the command 
  line. Updated pysys-examples/fibonacci to demonstrate the use of the 
  utility class
